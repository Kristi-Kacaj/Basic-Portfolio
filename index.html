        <p>It's been an unyeilding passion to pursue knowledge and self advancement. For over 6 years 
           I've worked in healthcare and costumer service insuring patient care and satisfaction. 
           Through these exploits I've acquired a diversity of experties including medical software 
           and coding, data management, analytic and diagnostic proficiency, and collegial teamwork.

        <br>

        <p>As an extroverted and personable communicator with a proven track record in medical software,
           my focus on building strong professional relationships has been a valuable asset throughout 
           my career. I am eager to re-enter the professional sphere as a Full Stack Software Developer
           and apply my newfound qualifications and advanced language knowledge such as HTML, CSS, 
           JQuery, Node js, MySQL, and more to the job!
